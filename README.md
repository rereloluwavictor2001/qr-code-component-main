## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I got to know the importance of container in bootstrap. I failed to use it at first and the content was not aligned to the center of the body.

### Useful resources

- [The Complete Web Development Bootcamp 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/learn/lecture/12374120?start=0#search) - This is the course I'm currently taking. I really like this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/) - Just where I check for syntaxes I was afraid I may likely code wrongly.
